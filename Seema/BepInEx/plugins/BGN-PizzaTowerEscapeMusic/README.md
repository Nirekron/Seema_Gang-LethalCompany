# Pizza Tower Escape Music
Plays music from Pizza Tower when the early ship leave alert appears. The track that plays can depend on your location and the current weather. The volume of the music also reacts to your current location and gets quieter if you're crouching.\
The mod behaves as displayed in the preview video by default, but it has a scripting system that allows you to completely redefine how the mod behaves, you can replace the music and create new events for when music should play.

## Track Conditions
These are the default conditions and their default music:
- Eclipsed/Stormy: `Thousand March`
- Inside the Facility: `Bye Bye There!`
- Outside the Facility: `It's Pizza Time!` OR `The Death That I Deservioli`

## Scripting
All the logic that drives the music playing is scriptable, meaning you can make entirely new logic for the mod and make it play whatever you want whenever you want!\
See the [Wiki](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/BGN/PizzaTowerEscapeMusic/wiki/) for more information on scripting.
