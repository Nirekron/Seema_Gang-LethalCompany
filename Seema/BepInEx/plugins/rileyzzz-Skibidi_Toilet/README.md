# Skibidi Toilet

Adds the world famous Skibidi Toilet enemy to your game.
Note: The Skibidi enemy is a completely new enemy type, **this mod is NOT a model replacement!**

Although it is based on the Jester, **it can exist simultaneously with the Jester, and any other enemy mods you have!**

This mod goes out to all the [zoomers out there needing a little more Skibidi in their life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJIkB839G_4).

## Info

### SPOILERS

The Skibidi enemy can spawn in all level types, it has a spawn chance of 22.
The AI is based on the Jester, with the exception that it's much easier to combat.
Initially when you approach the Skibidi Toilet, it appears to be a normal toilet...
As you walk away, however, the toilet will begin following you, until it activates.
The head will pop out and begin skibidi-ing. At this point, you can either run for your life or take your chances and fight at your own peril.
Unlike the Jester, the Skibidi Toilet can be stopped. It features a flush button on its back, but this is difficult to reach.
Upon flushing, the head will swirl down the drain and the monster will revert back into a normal toilet. You will have a short time to run away from the toilet before it begins roaming again.

Good luck soldier.
